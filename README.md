# Wii Linux Common Utility Scripts

These are common utility scripts shared across [configmii](https://github.com/Wii-Linux/configmii), [helpmii](https://github.com/Wii-Linux/helpmii), and possibly more in the future.  
These are here to provide a common look and feel across the different apps, and to streamline development.
